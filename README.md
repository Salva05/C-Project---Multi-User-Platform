# C-Project---Multi-User-Platform
Welcome to the "Multi-User Platform" project. This is a basic project written in C, designed as a practice exercise focusing on implementing read-write files features in the C programming language.

- C User Authentication and Management System
  
This C application serves as a practice project aimed at implementing a basic user authentication and management system. While the project primarily focuses on utilizing text files for data storage, it provides functionalities for user registration, login, and access to personalized user area.

- Features
  
User Registration: Users can register on the platform by providing necessary details which are stored in text files.

User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts securely to access their personalized areas.

Root User Access: The root user has special privileges to manage the platform, including database resets and user removal.

Subscription Display: Users can view a list of subscriptions, displaying their account names and level.

Personalized User Area: Upon login, users are directed to their personalized areas where they can view their level, score, and permissions.

Level Progression: Users can increase their level by playing a basic game (wordle) and winning, earning a fixed amount of scores that accumulate over time.

The project is structured in a modular manner, with different functionalities encapsulated within separate C files.

database.c: This file contains the main execution logic of the program, encompassing the user interface and interaction. The program connects to its header files, housing additional program logic such as core functionalities and auxiliary operations.
The program manages data by creating .txt files for each registered user, named using a specific convention based on the user's name and surname initials, along with the total number of registered users at the time of registration. These .txt files store user information, facilitating access, reading, and writing operations related to the user's personal area, including permissions, level, and total experience.
Additionally, the program utilizes data.txt to store user information provided during registration, and an index.txt file to track the total number of registered users, enabling various user operations such as ID number management, accessing, and removal from the root menu. The index.txt file also serves as a reference for correct ID generation.

- Usage

The program is designed to be run from the command line interface (CLI). To use it, download all files, create an empty directory and name it "usr", place it where "database.c" is located, and run "database.c" within an integrated development environment (IDE).

Important Note: This program has been developed exclusively for Linux using C. As a result, it is fully compatible only with Linux operating systems. Attempting to run it on other operating systems may trigger a different string management system, leading to disruptions in internal logic and potential bugs.
